# Resume
The resume builder for my resume.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bloodycelt/resume.git resume
cd resume
bundle install
thor resume:build resume.rl
```

## Umm... Why !!??
* Because I was bored.
* Also, I needed some decent code samples for my resume, so why not?
* Yes, I could really use a life, do you have any to spare?
